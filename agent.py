# Lab 03 - SEARCH AGENT
# The SearchAgent uses:
#     1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
#     2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
#     3. Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
# The agent receives:
#     - Current agent position
#     - Grid size
#     - Wall positions
#     - Food positions
# The agent then:
#     1. Selects a food target.
#     2. Searches for a path.
#     3. Stores the path as a plan.
#     4. Executes one action at a time.
